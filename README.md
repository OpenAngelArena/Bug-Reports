# Bug-Reports

Welcome to the short explanation for bug reporting,
as well as the bug report template.
 
Step 1
Find a bug and write down what happened, as well as your first thoughts on what you think caused it.
 
Step 2
Try to reproduce the bug. For this you need to understand what actually happened, leading up to the bug and when the actual bug happened. To make sure you get all this information correctly taking various forms of documentations, such as video, screenshots etc is essential. These steps makes it a lot easier to try and figure out what actually happened.
Try to replicate the scenario where the bug appeared, as close to the original as possible. What we would recommend for this step is using the bug reporting template which can be found on page 2 and simply adding the information you have / find in there.
 
Step 3 - can it be reproduced? Yes or no.
If yes:
Explain in as much detail as possible what happens when the bug occurs and why it occurs. Try and explain it as cleanly and as concise as possible to make sure that the coders don’t have to read an essay to understand what could be a simple bug with a simple fix. For this, remember that information is very subjective so it is much better to over communicate than to risk confusion.
If no:
Try to provide as much information about the bug as possible, so that the testers will be able to replicate the scenario in which the bug occurred more easily so we can try to reproduce the bug.
 
Notes:
Please remember to always record your testing sessions on your local hard drive and then upload them unlisted to youtube to conserve memory space on your computer and to give us easy access to your replays. This is to ensure that the optimal amount of documentation is available for the bug testers and coders to use as a guideline for either replicating scenarios, reproducing bugs or fixing them.




TL:DR Record all your stuff while playing the mod and report any bugs.
